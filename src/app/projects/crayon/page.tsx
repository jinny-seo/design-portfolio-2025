          <h2 className="font-PixelifySans mt-8 ">Background</h2>
          <p>Pharmacy managers could only access cost-saving alternatives through sales rep phone calls, creating three key problems:</p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>Sales reps spent valuable time explaining savings rather than building strategic relationships</li>
            <li>Customers missed time-sensitive opportunities between scheduled calls</li>
            <li>Access to savings information depended entirely on sales rep availability</li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>Our vision was to transform this internal PowerBI dashboard into a self-service external tool where customers could independently discover savings opportunities.</p>
