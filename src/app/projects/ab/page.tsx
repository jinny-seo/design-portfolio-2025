          <h2 className="font-PixelifySans mt-8">Background</h2>
          <p>Pharmacy managers could only access cost-saving alternatives through sales rep phone calls, creating three key problems:</p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>Sales reps spent valuable time explaining savings rather than building strategic relationships</li>
            <li>Customers missed time-sensitive opportunities between scheduled calls</li>
            <li>Access to savings information depended entirely on sales rep availability</li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>Our vision was to transform this internal PowerBI dashboard into a self-service external tool where customers could independently discover savings opportunities.</p>
        </CardContainer>

          <h2 className="font-PixelifySans">Stakeholder management</h2>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
            <div>
              <p>Initially, leadership pushed to port our internal PowerBI dashboard directly to customers to meet tight deadlines. Despite deadline pressures, I advocated for a foundational redesign rather than a direct port by making a case for user adoption.</p>
              <p>Additionally, I identified and resolved misalignment around MVP feature expectations, getting all stakeholders on the same page. This strategic pivot informed our navigation design, prioritizing user understanding and engagement.</p>

          <h2 className="font-PixelifySans">Navigation strategy</h2>
          <p>When analyzing the PowerBI dashboard, I identified that traditional filters alone would overwhelm users with pharmaceutical jargon. Instead, I advocated for an interactive approach where...</p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>Upper tables acted as intuitive visual filters</li>
            <li>Complex terminology was contextualized within familiar data</li>
            <li>Selecting accounts/products dynamically filtered the detailed view</li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>While the initial MVP scope called for static tables to expedite delivery, I built a business case for these interactions by...</p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>Demonstrating how interactive elements would significantly reduce the learning curve</li>
            <li>Presenting clickable prototypes to illustrate the usability benefits</li>
            <li>Showing how this approach would encourage exploration of cost-saving opportunities</li>

          <h2 className="font-PixelifySans">KPI visualization</h2>
          <p>PRxO contribution metrics are critical for customers of AmerisourceBergen, as reaching certain thresholds impacts available discounts.</p>
          <p>However, I identified a critical disconnect: AmerisourceBergen measured PRxO compliance in <b>percentages for discount qualification</b>, but the source design only displayed <b>absolute dollar amounts.</b></p>
          <p>My solution was to transform this KPI into a more active decision-making tool by...</p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>Redesigning the metrics display to emphasize percentage contribution supported by dollar amounts</li>
            <li>Creating a prominent KPI showing total PRxO contribution with a companion percentage showing potential increase</li>
            <li>Connecting these metrics to the interactive filtering system so users could see real-time updates as they explored different product alternatives</li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>This approach directly aligned the interface with the actual business decision-making process, allowing users to immediately see how close they were to discount thresholds and identify which product substitutions would be most effective.</p>

          <h2 className="font-PixelifySans">Usability enhancements</h2>
          <p>Additionally, I identified and addressed several critical barriers to effective use of the application.</p>
          <h3 className="subheading">Streamlined information architecture</h3>
          <BulletList>
            <li>Reducing 23 jargon-heavy columns to 10 essential ones</li>
            <li>Grouping related information logically</li>
            <li>Translating internal terminology into user-friendly language</li>
          </BulletList>
          <h3 className="subheading">Clear visual hierarchy</h3>
          <BulletList>
            <li>Clearly separated Accounts, Products, and Opportunities sections</li>
            <li>Implemented visual indicators for savings potential</li>
            <li>Created distinct styling for interactive elements</li>
          </BulletList>
          <h3 className="subheading">Enhanced product identification</h3>
          <p>A pain point I discovered through customer and stakeholder interviews was that users were translating between different product identification systems (ABC, ABC8, NDC) using lookup tools.</p>
          <p>My solution introduced an elegant dropdown system built directly into the product tables to allow seamless switching between ID systems without disrupting workflow or losing context.</p>

              <li>Achieved 8.2/10 rating with 10 participants, receiving the highest score out of the three tools tested</li>
              <li>Customers praised clarity, usability, and business value of the product</li>
            </BulletList>
            <p>The dashboard designs and the usability findings were presented at a C-level stakeholders meeting, who enthusiastically approved the next phase of development, securing buy-in for this proposal originally pitched by the Senior Director.</p>
